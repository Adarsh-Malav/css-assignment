        <h2>How can the background color of an element be changed?</h2>
        <p>To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.</p>

        <h2>What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</h2>
        <p>CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What is embedded style sheets?</h2>
        <p>An embedded style sheet is declared within the <head> element of an XHTML document. It applies to the whole document, rather than just one element. Each style declaration (or CSS rule) gets applied to everything in the document that matches that rule.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What are the external style sheets?</h2>
        <p>An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.</p>

        <h2>What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</h2>
        <p> a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.</p>

        <h2>What are the media types allowed by CSS?</h2>
        <p>One of the most important features of style sheets is that they specify how a document is to be presented on different media: on the screen, on paper, with a speech synthesizer, with a braille device, etc.
